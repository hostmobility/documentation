## Overview
Our products are equipped with at least one USB port and many of them also have a USB OTG port where it is possible to connect e.g. keyboards, memory sticks or a PC (to enable "Ethernet over USB").

## Platform specific
- [HMX](hmx/usb.md)
- [MX-V](mxv/usb.md)
- [C61](c61/usb.md)
- [MX-4](mx4/usb.md)

## Ethernet over USB
Ethernet over USB is supported via RNDIS. Connect a USB-A cable to the
USB0 port on the supported platforms and a free USB port on e.g. a PC, then power on
the unit or reboot. (The MX-4 has the capacity to switch from host to peripheral state when powered.) This will give the PC the IP address 192.168.250.2 and the product 192.168.250.1.
