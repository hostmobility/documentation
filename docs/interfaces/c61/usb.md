## Overview
* One USB-A 2.0 with OTG support. 

* The currently provided BSP (using Linux 4.19) does not support the OTG functionality. Instead, the USB port is just a USB Host port. This will be fixed in a coming BSP release. If you are using Linux 4.4 you will be able to use 'Ethernet over USB'.*
