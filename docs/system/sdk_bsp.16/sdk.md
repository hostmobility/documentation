## Overview

Legacy toolchains are available at [hostmobility.org:8008/tools](http://hostmobility.org:8008/tools/).
**Note:** This giude is for use with bsp 1.6/1.5 or older.

Main software components:

- Tool-chain
	- Tegra2: Linaro GCC 4.7-2013.09 (http://releases.linaro.org/13.09/components/toolchain/gcc-linaro/4.7)
- Linux (Tegra2: 3.1.10)
- U-boot (Tegra2: 2011.06)
- Ã…ngstrom distribution built with yocto (dylan branch)(https://www.yoctoproject.org/)



## Building

SDKs are built toolchain binaries are generated with yocto command `-c populate_sdk`. Toolchains are built for both 32 and 64 bit systems.

There are two flavors of sysroots. The minimal is based on `console-vcc-base-image` and the other one is based on `lxde-mx4-image`.

**Note:**There is a problem with installation where you get segmentation faults when trying to run a binary. See this link http://developer.toradex.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-qt-creator-to-cross-compile-for-embedded-linux#Install_the_SDK for a workaround.

**Note:** Linaro 2013.04 is also compatible with the above toolchains. https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries/trunk/2013.04/+download/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.7-2013.04-20130415_linux.tar.xz.
