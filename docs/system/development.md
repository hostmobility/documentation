## Overview

Host Mobility computers run GNU/Linux where almost all software is built from source. The target architectures are ARM32 and ARM64. Since the typical development machines are x86_64, a cross-compiler is usually required.

[Software Development Kits (SDKs)](sdk/sdk.md) contain the toolchains needed to compile and debug applications for our systems.


## Yocto build system

The reference operating system is built using Yocto. It combines software written by Host Mobility with free software from developers all over the world. See [Yocto Build System](yocto.md) for details.
